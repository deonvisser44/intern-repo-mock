## What makes a good variable or function name?

A good variable or function name is descriptive and self-explanatory. It should clearly convey the purpose or action it represents without requiring additional context or comments. Ideally, a variable name should reflect the data it holds, and a function name should describe the action it performs. Following consistent naming conventions and keeping names concise yet informative are key factors in choosing good names.

### Key points for good names:

- Descriptive and meaningful
- Follows project’s naming conventions
- Easy to understand at a glance
- Reflects the context of the code (what, how, why)

## What issues can arise from poorly named variables?

Poorly named variables can lead to confusion and mistakes in code. When variables or functions have vague or misleading names, it becomes difficult to understand what they represent or what they do. This can lead to the following issues:

- Reduced Readability: Future developers or even the original developer may struggle to quickly grasp the purpose of the variable or function.
- Increased Bugs: Misleading names can cause developers to misunderstand the code logic, potentially leading to errors when making changes.
- Difficulty in Maintenance: As the project grows, poorly named variables make it harder to maintain and refactor code efficiently.
- Inconsistent Code: If the naming conventions aren't followed, code can become inconsistent, making it harder for team members to collaborate.

## How did refactoring improve code readability?

Refactoring improved the code readability by giving clear, descriptive names to the variables and functions. Instead of generic names like `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, which don’t provide any context, we used names like `price`, `quantity`, `total`, and `finalAmount`, which directly convey the purpose of each variable.

This change makes the code easier to follow and understand, both for current developers and future collaborators. Refactoring also ensures that the code is more maintainable, as the logic behind the variables is now clear and unambiguous. Ultimately, clearer names reduce cognitive load, making the code more approachable and less prone to mistakes.
